### Why?
I decided to make improvements to the faucet code. [Duco Faucet Furime](https://codeberg.org/Furim/Duco_Faucet_Furime) was last updated in 2021, and since then, it has become completely inactive. Therefore, I took the initiative to fix all the issues in the codebase.

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+ (or Python 3.11.2 is recommended)
- Flask
- Flask-limiter
- Requests
- Other package (random, socket, jsonify and others) in python.

### File
- If you want edit website, then use ``templates/index.html`` to edit faucet website
- If you want edit faucet config, then use ``faucet.py`` to edit faucet config
